# Beginning Game Programming V2.0

I am implementing this tutorial in C to learn how to create graphical interfaces for my projects.

Each lesson program comes with a Makefile for easy compilation and testing.

# How to compile
The SDL2 library is needed to compile these projects. https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

On linux:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

Projects from lesson-06 onwards need the SDL_image extension library.

On linux:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
```

Projects from lesson-16 onwards need the SDL_ttf extension library.

On linux:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
```
